# Health Disparities Between Male and Female Patients

Unequal Access, Unequal Outcomes

<endl>

This small comic visually represents the health disparities faced by different genders, emphasizing the unequal access to healthcare resources and the varying health outcomes that results. The drawing starkly contrasts two hospital beds, emphasizing differences in attention and comfort. The left side depicts the struggles a female individual may face to get the healthcare that she needs, represented by the messy sheets, sparse medical equipment, and lack of comfort. This symbolizes how woman often face neglect and inadequate care in a biased healthcare system. On the other hand, the right side of the drawing is pristine, the bed is neatly made and the room has extra amenities, like the window and flowers, that provide comfort and and an optimistic atmosphere. The patient has access to the medical care that he may need. Women's concerns in healthcare are often dismissed, with them having to go through multiple specialists to get a diagnosis. This is especially prevalent among marginalized, low-income demographics. This is an issue that needs more attention and I hope my comic sheds some light on this disparity.
